# Critical Section Analyzer

A simulation of the operating system as resources are used. How some resources cannot be used at certain times as it can affect the quality of use. For example two resoures cannot write
in the same area at the same time. But one can read from it while another does so too. One can read and write if allowed to. There is a lot of exeption handling and case switching to
demonstrate what the operating does all the time.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** C++

Using C++ with the intentions of imitating the operating system and its functionalities.

## Optimizations

We can add more resources and exceptions. 

## Lessons Learned:

The operating system is a wizard. It does so much behind the curtain.
